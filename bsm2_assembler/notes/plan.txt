Loop through inputs reading into memory

Loop through each instruction checking if the first char is "#"
if it is, record the label name and the address

Loop through each instruction checking which instruction name it
matches, (if it starts with #, ignore that part)
then it converts any registers mentioned into their memory addresses
and any labels into their addresses
